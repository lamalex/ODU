# PointNet
Segmentation and Classification of point-clouds with Deep Learning

`Alex Launi & Tareq Alghamdi `
` ODU CS722 Fall 2020`

## What is PointNet?
Point net is a **deep learning** approach for **scene segmentation** and **object classification** of 3D structures.

*for example:* Take an Microsoft Kinect scan of a room. We can use `PointNet` to find all of the unique objects in the scan, and identify them!
